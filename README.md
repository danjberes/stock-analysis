# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this code is to automate the process of analyzing a year return for particular stocks. Previously, the code was created with a nested loop that worked well for the small sample size of stocks we were analyzing. However, if we were to expand the number of stocks we were analyzing, the amount of time it would take to run through the code would increase significantly. Refactoring the code from the module is more efficient due to the removal of a nested for loop statement.
